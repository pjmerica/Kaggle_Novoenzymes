## Libraries

```{r}



library(tidyverse)
library(bio3d)

```

## Reading in data

```{r}

train = read.csv("train.csv")

training_updates= read.csv("train_updates_20220929.csv")

test = read.csv("test.csv")

pdbfile = read.pdb("wildtype_structure_prediction_af2.pdb" )

proteinsequence = pdbfile$atom

head(train)

```

## Data Cleaning and Grouping/Preparing

### Data Cleaning for update (dropping bad data)

```{r}



# Creating a vector of seq ID's that need to be eliminated

seq_id_list = training_updates$seq_id

head(train)



# Getting id of all the Bad Rows.

Updated_Train= train[!train$seq_id %in% seq_id_list ,]


```

### Grouping Train Data so we can identify mutations

```{r}
library(stringr)

## Creating Group var with dummy var
Updated_Train[,"group"] = -1


## Getting lengths of all the protein sequence in the dataset

Updated_Train$protein_length = str_length(Updated_Train$protein_sequence) 

Updated_Train$protein_length
grp = 0

summary(Updated_Train)
```












## EDA and Fun Graphs

### Length of Protein Sequences

```{r}

hist(Updated_Train$protein_length, xlim = c(0,2000))
```
