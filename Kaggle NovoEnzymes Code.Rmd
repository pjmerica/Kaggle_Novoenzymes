## Libraries


```{r}



library(tidyverse)







```



## Reading in data



```{r}

train = read.csv("train.csv")

training_updates= read.csv("train_updates_20220929.csv")

test = read.csv("test.csv")

head(train)

```




### Data Cleaning for update (dropping bad data)





```{r}



# Creating a vector of seq ID's that need to be eliminated

seq_id_list = training_updates$seq_id

head(train)



# Getting id of all the Bad Rows.

Updated_Train= train[!train$seq_id %in% seq_id_list ,]



```
